    <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="what is JavaScript">
      JavaScript</a>,[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is
      high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
      curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
      and first-class functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
      essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it
      for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
      and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
      (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
      structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language
      itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
      storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment provides those APIs.
