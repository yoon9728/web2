    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="what is html">
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents
    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
    such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
    a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
    document.</p>
    <p>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
    and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
